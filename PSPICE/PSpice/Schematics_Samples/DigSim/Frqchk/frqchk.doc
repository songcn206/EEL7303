  Simulate an All-Digital Frequency-Comparator Circuit Using PSpice/PLogic



This article illustrates how a hierarchical all-digital design with two
implementation views, can be defined in Schematics, and subsequently
simulated in PSpice/PLogic.  This discussion is relevant to version 5.2 and
later of the Design Center.  The example circuit is a basic frequency-compar-
ator (see Figure 1).  All parts used in the schematic are provided in the
standard Symbol and Model Libraries.  One implementation is chosen for PSpice/
PLogic simulation to demonstrate the circuit's behavior.

The frequency-comparator circuit accepts two reference frequency inputs, and
a test frequency input which is compared to the references. After initial-
ization and start-up, the circuit produces fast, slow, OK, and error indica-
tions. Operation is continuous as long as both of the reference signals are
applied.

Initialization is accomplished by applying a low pulse to the INIT input,
having a minimum width of 40 nsec.  At least 40 nsec after the negative-going
edge of the INIT input, circuit operation commences upon applying a negative-
going edge to the RUN input.

Outputs of the circuit-SLOW, FAST, OK, and ERROR-are pulses indicating the
result of comparing the test frequency signal, FTEST, to the low and high
frequency reference signals, REFL and REFH, respectively.   The ERROR pulse
is generated if more than 7 complete periods of the REFL signal are observed
with no activity on the FTEST input during that time.

Implementation

The frequency-comparator circuit is designed in Schematics using hierarchical
blocks (logic shown on these facing pages) for the initializer (INIT block),
cycle-detectors (PICD blocks), state-decoder (SDL block), and error-detector
(EDL block).  The design has two alternative implementations:  a gate-level
implementation using off-the-shelf 74xx parts (see Figure 5), and a function-
ally equivalent implementation using a mixture of 74xx parts and a commonly
available Programmable Array Logic (PAL) device, PAL20RP4B (see Figure 6).
Both implementations use the digital stimulus include file "frqchk.stm",
providing definitions for the INIT, RUN, MODE, REFH, REFL, FTEST and SYSCLK
input signals (see Figure 9 on page 5).

The design alternatives are implemented as two views of the SDL block, with
the DEFAULT view being the gate-level implementation, and the PAL-IMPL view
being the PAL implementation.  For the PAL-IMPL view, the data required to
program the PAL20RP4B device is supplied in a JEDEC file, "frqchk.jed,"
generated using OrCAD/PLD (see Figure 8 on page 5). 


Operation

The three frequency inputs-REFL, REFH, FTEST-each drive a separate instance
of a cycle-detector circuit (PICD blocks).  Each cycle-detector is made up
of two pairs of D-type flip-flops and a few basic gates.  
After having been "reset" and "enabled," the cycle-detectors output a HI
level as soon as two similar edges (e.g., falling) have been applied.  This
indicates that one complete period of the input signal has been observed.  

The circuit implements a simple finite-state machine (see Figure 7) that
recognizes the order in which the individual frequency inputs make complete
cycles.  For example, suppose that the REFH signal period is observed first
(generating N1), followed by the REFL signal period (generating N2), then
the FTEST period (generating N0). This indicates that the FTEST frequency is
too low and that the SLOW output should be pulsed.   But if the FTEST period
is observed before the REFL cycle, an OK pulse is produced.   The state
machine "current state" simply represents the order of activity that has been
observed since the last "initialization" or "reset," which occurs every time
any kind of output pulse is generated.

The cycle-detectors monitor the input activity and produce the "next state"
value (N3, N2, N1, N0), which is fed to the state-decoder (SDL block).  At a
rate determined by the system clock, SYSCLK, this "next state" becomes the
"current state"; the 74154 4/16 decoders in the gate-level view of the state-
decoder, continually provide unary logic indications of the next/current
"transitions" (since "next state" values are not synchronized to SYSCLK).
The random combinational logic in this same view recognizes the specific
transitions that comprise the conditions of interest, i.e., FAST, SLOW, and
OK, as per the state-transition diagram.  (In the PAL view, the PAL20RP4B
device replaces all of the decoding logic as well as the 4-bit register
representing the "current state" value.   The alternative implementations are
functionally identical.)  Note that the output indicators are not "static"
state assignments; they are derived from selected state transitions.  Thus,
S14 -> S15 recognizes a SLOW condition, while S10 -> S15 signifies an OK
condition.

The error-detector logic (EDL block) waits for the TIMEOUT signal output by
the timeout-generator.  The timeout-generator is simply a counter whose Q3
output indicates that the 8th rising edge of the low frequency reference,
REFL, has occurred.  If none of the normal output indicators (SLOW, FAST, or
OK) have occurred before TIMEOUT, the ERROR output is asserted.  The error
detector also asserts its DONE output whenever any of FAST, SLOW, OK, or
ERROR have occurred.

The initialization/reset logic (INIT block) performs two functions.  One
distributes the effects of the INIT and RUN inputs, as defined in the
stimulus include file, "frqchk.stm" (see Figure 9).  The other uses the DONE
signal from the error-detector to generate a RESET pulse; this has the same
effect as the external RUN pulse-to restore the state machine to its starting
state (0) as well as reset the cycle-detectors, timeout generator, and flip-
flops in the error-detector.  Normal operation then resumes.


PSpice/PLogic Simulation-PAL View

To simulate the PAL implementation of the frequency-comparator circuit, these
steps must be followed:

(1)	The transient analysis must be enabled under the Analysis/Setup
        command.  The transient analysis is defined with:  Print Step = 1us,
        Final Time = 1ms.

(2)	All flip-flops must be initialized in the 0 state (rather than the
        default X state).  This is set with the DIGINITSTATE option under
        the Analysis/Setup/Options command.  This allows the simulator to
        properly initialize the circuit by forcing the reset logic to a
        deterministic state (non X; the hardware implementation would
        eventually sync itself to the input stimuli and operate correctly).

(3)	In the top-level schematic, the SDL block is the only block with more
        than one view.  Without further setup, Schematics will generate the
        PSpice/PLogic netlist using the DEFAULT gate-level view for SDL.  
	To use the PAL view instead, the PAL-IMPL view name must be specified
        in the View field of the Translators dialog (under the
        Configure/Translators command).  After running 	the simulation by
        selecting Analysis/Simulate, the state-machine operation is viewed
        in Probe by placing markers on the appropriate wires and buses
        (using the Markers/Mark Voltage/Level command), or by typing the sig-
        nal names in the Probe dialog under the Trace/Add command as follows:

		SYSCLK, REFH, REFL, FTEST
		FAST, SLOW, OK, ERROR
		{N3, N2, N1, N0};NEXT
		{C3, C2, C1, C0};CURRENT

	Figure 10 demonstrates correct response of the circuit to the digital
        stimulus at FTEST. If you are currently running version 5.3 of the
        Design Center-System 3 (under Microsoft Windows or Sun OpenWindows),
        and would like a copy of the schematic files for the frequency-
        comparator circuit, please contact OrCAD PSpice Technical Support.
